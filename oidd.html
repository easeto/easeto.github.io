            <h1>OIDD290 Final Project</h1>
		    <h2>Topics: The Planning Fallacy, Motivated Reasoning</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
			<p>I asked every student in UPenn about their procrastination. And this is what I got.</p>
			<p>So many people do this. What are the benefits of procrastinating?</p>
			<p>
				Let's take a look at the stress level. I hooked every student to some transparent medical stress tracker and got these 
				results for procrastinators versus nonprocrastinators. I plotted the data into this graph.
			</p>
			<p>
				And when you take an actual look at the potential quality that everyone could produce by not procrastinating instead 
				of the actual quality that is produced after procrastination, then it becomes clear what is best.
			</p>
			<p>
				In other words,....
			</p>
			<p>
				So why does this happen? Let's take a look at this following example
			</p>
            <h2>
                How I did this Final Project???
            </h2>
            <p>*Note: this is not really how I did it</p>
            <p>
                So in class, Professor Moon presented what we had to do. The Final Project & Poster was due April 11th and
                the Pitch was due April 19th/21st. I looked at the dates and checked my calendar.
            </p>
            <p>
                And my calendar looked like this...
            </p>
            <p>
                I am chilling. I had 4 full weeks until it was due. I should be able to get this done over the weekend.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before I knew it, my calendar looked like this...
            </p>
            <p>
                So I sat down in my desk this past Saturday. I had my grapes and my water. I recently had cleaned up my desk and was ready to tackle this
                assignment. I came up with this beautiful outline of what I needed to do and how I was going to tackle this. 
            </p>
            <h3>
                My Outline
            </h3>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    item
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>But then I realized I had some questions that I needed answering.</p>
            <h3>
                My Questions
            </h3>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    item
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>I looked at my computer and the time said...</p>
            <h3>AHHHHHHH</h3>
            <p>Looked down at my outline and checked out what I actually got done.</p> 
            <p>Looked at Canvas to see when OIDD office hours were</p>
            <h1> AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH </h1>
            <p>And the next day I just kept going. Running into issues and confusions I didn't expect. First I didn't expect
                it would take this long to figure out which concepts I wanted to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                And then when I found the concepts I wanted, it took forever to figure out exactly how I wanted to do this project.
                How could I make this creative but make sense?
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh and I also scheduled lunches and hangouts with people... why?????
            </p>
            <p>This is what my desktop looked like.</p>
            <p>And the next day played out the exact way. Fortunately, I got it done.</p>

        <div>
            <p>As I submit, I realize how badly this project is going to look, but to comfort myself, I know that my gpa doesn't matter
                so I can flunk this project.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Why my GPA doesn't matter.
            </h2>
            <p>
                So after consulting some friends and looking at some people's LinkedIn, I found these results
            </p>
            <p>
                Apparently, these people also did this. They are only a few people out of a thousand, but I thin
            </p>
            <p>
                I also ran into some of these comments.
            </p>
            <p>
                But honestly, those don't make much sense to me. So I'm just gonna ignore them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Conclusion: my GPA doesn't matter.
